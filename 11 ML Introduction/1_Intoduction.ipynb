    "🌟 What is Supervised Machine Learning?\n",
    "Supervised ML is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "✨ How It Works (Workflow)\n",
    "1. Data collection -> Gather label dataset.\n",
    "    - Example: House features (size, location, rooms) -> House price.\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing -> cleaning, handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.\n",
    "3. Splitting Data -> Training set (to learn) + Test set (to evaluate).\n",
    "4. Training Model -> Feed training data to an ML algorithm.\n",

    "✨ 3. Reinforcemnt Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning paradigm where an agent learns by interacting with an environment.\n",
    "- The agent takes actions.\n",
    "- The environment gives rewards on penalties (feedback).\n",
    "- The goal is to learn a policy (strategy) that maximizes long-term rewards.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Key Components of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "1. Agent -> Learner/decision-makes (e.gm a robot, a game bot).\n",
    "2. Environment -> The world the agent interacts with.\n",
    "3. State (S) -> Current situation of the agent in the environment,\n",
    "4. Action (A) -> Choices the agent can make.\n",
    "5. Reward (R) -> Feedback from the environment after an action.\n",
    "6. Policy (⊓) -> Strategy that the agent follows to choose actions.\n",
    "7. Value Function -> Expected long-term reward from a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "✌️ How Reinforcement Learning Works (Cycle)\n",
    "1. The agent observes the state of environment.\n",
    "2. It chooses an action based on its policy.\n",
    "3. The environment changes and provides a reward.\n",
    "4. The agent updates its strategy (policy) to maximize future rewards.\n",
